# Pacman_Game
This Java program presents a simplified version of the classic Pac-man game implemented with a 2D grid structure. The game involves maneuvering Pac-man through a maze to consume dots while avoiding ghosts that move strategically toward Pac-man. The player initiates each move for Pac-man, followed by the ghosts, calculating the shortest path to reach Pac-man using Breadth-First Search. The grid contains various elements, including Pac-man, ghosts, dots, obstacles, and empty cells. The user interacts with the game by entering directional commands for Pac-man's movement. The game concludes when all dots are consumed, or a ghost catches Pac-man. The program displays the game grid, player points, and the ghosts' moves with the lengths of their shortest paths. The code maintains clarity and readability, effectively demonstrating algorithmic and game logic skills.
